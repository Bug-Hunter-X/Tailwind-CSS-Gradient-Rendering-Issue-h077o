# Tailwind CSS Gradient Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue with Tailwind CSS gradients: inconsistent rendering across different browsers. The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` offers a solution.

## Problem
The gradient defined using Tailwind's `bg-gradient-to-r` class does not render consistently across all browsers. This is likely caused by a configuration or dependency issue.

## Solution
The solution involves verifying your Tailwind CSS configuration and ensuring that all necessary dependencies are installed and up-to-date.  See `bugSolution.js` for a more robust solution with fallback mechanisms.
