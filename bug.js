```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 text-white p-4 rounded-lg shadow-lg">
  <!-- Content -->
</div>
```
This code uses Tailwind CSS classes for a gradient background. However, depending on the browser or Tailwind CSS version, the gradient might not render correctly. This is usually due to incorrect configuration or missing dependencies.
